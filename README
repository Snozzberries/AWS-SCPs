A collection of AWS Service Control Policies (SCP) with the intent of enforcing general best practices.

Preference towards white listing specific actions, services, or conditions is in place to ensure forward compatability as new actions, regions, or other services are created in the future.

ScpServiceDeny - Deny any service not explicitly listed in NotAction.

ScpRegionDeny - Deny API calls to any region not explicitly listed in "aws:RequestedRegion" values. US-East-1 is the Global API endpoint, meaning it should always be allowed.
